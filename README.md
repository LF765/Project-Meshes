1.) Please make sure that all required Python packages (as imported in main.py, functions.py and classes.py) are installed.
2.) Run functions.py and classes.py, where helper functions and several classes are implemented.
3.) You can now run main.py, either as a whole or each of the problem sections individually.

The code is commented and documented within the .py scripts.
